# Millennium Machines Documentation

This repository contains the source for the Millennium Machines documentation website.

While the documentation is written in Markdown, it is rendered using `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material`, which allow for some custom formatting. You should view the documentation on the website itself, [https://millenniummachines.github.io/docs](https://millenniummachines.github.io/docs) rather than through the GitHub interface for the best experience.

**CAUTION**: This is a work-in-progress, as we move the current Milo documentation into this repository and allow it to be extended to our other projects. Please continue to submit documentation issues to the specific product issues list.
