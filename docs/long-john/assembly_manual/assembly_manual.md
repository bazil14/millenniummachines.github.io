!!! info annotate "Threadlocker"
    These machines vibrate an immense amount when in use and fasteners are bound to back out. Donâ€™t be afraid to add a little bit of medium-strength threadlocker to your central screw to avoid this problem. Threadlocker should **not** be used on the self tapping screws as the chemicals in threadlocker may damage the ABS and cause it to weaken.
